# AL Jet - Your Private Oasis Amongst the Clouds!
Hey there! This is a simple, multi-page web project I put together to show what a luxury private jet service, "AL Jet," could look like. It's a super solid base if you ever want to scale it up into a complete, working flight booking platform later on!

The whole idea behind the design was to make it look classy, tidy, and fully responsive (which means it looks great everywhere!). We focused on official colors like Navy Blue and White to give off a vibe of trust and luxury.

## Cool Features (What We Built!)
Complete Pages: We've got the main landing page, detailed aircraft specs, sign-up/sign-in forms, and the Terms & Conditions page.

Dynamic Showcase: We used plain old Vanilla JavaScript to load the jet cards onto the main page. This makes updating the aircraft data way easier!

Responsive Design: We used CSS the right way, making sure the site looks sharp and works flawlessly on all screens (phones, tablets, and desktops).

Aesthetic Touch: The colors and fonts (like Cairo and Lora) are all consistent, giving it that perfect, high-end brand feel.

Basic Checks: We added some initial checks (Basic Validation) using JavaScript for the sign-in and sign-up forms.

# Project Structure (Where to Find Stuff!)
The HTML is split into clear, separate files, and they all rely on one smart CSS file:

# Future Potential (Where We Can Take This!)

- Add **backend integration** (Node.js, Django, or Flask) to handle dynamic booking and user authentication.  
- Integrate **database support** (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for storing user and flight details.  
- Implement **payment gateway** for online booking and transactions.  
- Improve **UI/UX** with frameworks like React or Vue.js.  
- Add **AI-powered recommendation system** for personalized flight options..
